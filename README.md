Photographer Portfolio Landing Page

This is a course and project I found on Udemy.
 I decided to participate and follow the course from the beggining till the end,
 and create my first landing web page.

 I made changes to the page in the sense that instead of some imaginary data
 and Unsplash pics, I used my original pictures and data related to me.
 So, at the end I have a page that will serve as my photography skills portfolio.

 Tools I was using to design the page are: HTML, CSS, JQuery, Photoshop,
 Google Forms, Google Fonts and Font Awesome. The page is fully responsive.

 I have also published the site through GitHub Pages, so you can easily inspect it. 

 If you like what I made and would like to contact me with questions or offers,
 my E-mail address is: vogonpoetdesign@gmail.com.
